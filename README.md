# PyWeatherApp

Weather App is a Python script that fetches and displays the current weather conditions for a specified location using the WeatherAPI. It also provides the option to convert the weather information into spoken words.

## Prerequisites

Before running the script, ensure you have Python installed on your system. You can install it from the [official Python website](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

Additionally, you'll need to install the `requests` library to make HTTP requests and the `pyttsx3` library for text-to-speech functionality. You can install them via pip:

```bash
pip install requests pyttsx3
```

## Usage

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/subhranil002/PyWeatherApp.git
```

2. Navigate to the directory containing `WeatherApp.py`.

3. Run the script using Python:

```bash
python WeatherApp.py
```

4. Follow the on-screen instructions to input the name of the place for which you want to check the weather.
